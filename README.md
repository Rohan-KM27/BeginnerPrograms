Simple Programs - First Semester Engineering


This repository contains a collection of simple programs that I created during my first semester of engineering. These programs were developed as part of my interest and cover basic concepts in programming

Note
I created this repo during my first semester of engineering to showcase some of the simple programs I learned. Although it has been a while since I last updated this repo, I am currently in the process of updating it with new and improved code. Please bear with me as I work on making these changes. Thank you for visiting my repo!
